SkypLabs, like many other businesses, could not exist without all the resources
freely available online thanks to many awesome communities, especially
open-source software communities. Indeed, we rely heavily on free and
open-source software in our daily work, internally and with our clients. This is
why it is important to us to give back, and one way to achieve this is to write
about our engineering work.

This is why we are now starting a blog! You will find here posts mainly about
our technical work in many areas, such as software engineering, security related
topics, and more.

We hope you will enjoy it.
